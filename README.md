# PETALS is a framework for growing healthy teams

Created by [Si Jobling](https://github.com/si) in 2022 as a self-relective model, it  evolved into a team-based exercise for regularly taking a health check and discussing improvement areas, and gained popularity across the UK tech scene thanks to some organisations and publications sharing the love.

There's now a website available at [petals.team](https://petals.team) ([open-sourced](https://github.com/PETALS-team/web)) and an app in progress, along with a number of frameworks for common software suites like Google and Microsoft Office.
